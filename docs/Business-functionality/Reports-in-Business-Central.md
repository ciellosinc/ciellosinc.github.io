# Ad-hoc data analysis

## [Analyze list page and query data using data analysis mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/analysis-mode)

End users and data analysts can analyze data from lists directly in the client without the need to open the page in Excel or run a report.

The ability to analyze data directly in lists raises the bar for what you can do without having to switch applications, while still allowing customers and partners to do more in report objects, Excel, Power BI, or other data analysis applications.

## [Accounts Receivable Reports and Analytics in Business Central](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/dynamics365/business-central/receivables-reports)

The following table describes some of the key reports in accounts receivable reporting.

| Report | Description | Id | 
|--|--|--|
| [Aged Accounts Receivables](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=120) | Shows the amount outstanding with customers broken down into time intervals for the overdue time. The report also displays the part of the customers' balance that is not due and can be shown with or without document details for each customer. This report is the main report for reconciling customer ledger to G/L. Assuming you have not allowed direct posting to the accounts used in the customer posting groups' receivables account, this report is a specification of the amounts you find in G/L. | 120 |
| [Customer Statement](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=1316) | Generates a customer statement for a specified time interval. It's usually sent to the customers to give them an overview of outstanding amounts and also as a reminder to pay any overdue amounts. You can choose to show the overdue amounts in a separate section. You can include an aging band similar to the one used in the **Aged Receivables** report. For the aging band, you typically set *30D*, which means 30 days intervals such as30, 60, 90, and 90+ days overdue, from the ending date, or *1M+CM*, which will be the current month in a separate interval and then monthly intervals for the preceding months. **Note**: In the customer list, this report also has a separate action, **Scheduled Statements**. This option does not filter to the customer you have selected. It's the same report but used when you want to send statement to all/more customers. You can filter the report so that it shows only entries that are still open for the customer. To apply the filter when you're setting up the report, in the **Statement Style** field, choose **Open Items**. | 1316 |
| [Customer - Balance to Date](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=121) | Shows the open customer ledger entries until the ending date. This report shows similar content as the customer statement but with no indication if the entry is overdue. **Note**: The date filter will be applied to the detailed customer ledger entries. This means that if you have payments later than the ending date that have been applied to invoices in within the date range, the invoices will appear in the report as they have not been closed as per the ending date. | 121 | 
| [Customer - Trial Balance](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=129) | Shows the net changes for customers for the period specified in the date filter as well as the net change year-to-date for the fiscal year corresponding to the period selected. The report is grouped by customer posting groups and will give a different view of the customer ledger than the **Aged Account Receivables** report. **Note**: If you haven't set up any accounting period, the system will not know what fiscal year to use and will either show year-to-date from the most recent fiscal year defined or just select the period, which may or may not be from beginning of a year.| 129 |
| [Customer - Detail Trial Balance](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=104) | Shows all the customer ledger entries within the specified date filter. This report is generally used to check that all entries for a specific customer are accounted for, or other internal checks on customer ledgers. | 104 |
| [Customer - Payment Receipt](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=211) | Creates a payment receipt for each customer ledger entry of type **Payment**. If the payment has been applied to invoices, the invoices will be specified; otherwise, it will just state the payment amount as unapplied. This report is used to send to customers that want documentation for receipt of payment.| 211 |
| [Reconcile Customer and Vendor Accounts](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=33) | Shows the G/L entries resulting from posting customer and vendor entries split per G/L account and posting groups. This report is used for reconciling the balances on customer and vendor ledgers to general ledger balances. | 33 |
| [Customer - Summary Aging Simp.](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=109)| This is a legacy version of an accounts receivables aging report. We recommend you use the **Aged Accounts Receivables** report instead. | 109 |
| [Sales Statistics](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=112) | Shows amounts for sales, profit, invoice discount, and payment discount in LCY, and the profit percentage for each customer. The costs and profits are given as both the original and adjusted amounts. The original costs and profits are those values that were calculated at the time of posting, and the adjusted costs and profits reflect changes to the original costs of the items in the sales. The cost adjustment amount shown in the report is the difference between the original cost and the adjusted cost.<br>The figures are divided into three periods. You can select the length of the period, starting on a selected date. There are also columns for amounts before and after the three periods. Use the report to analyze earnings from an individual customer and earnings trends, for example.<br>In the US, Canada, and Mexico, this report is not available. Instead, use the **Customer Sales Statistics** ([10047](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=10047)) report. <br>This report can also be used in accounts receivable as it's easier to do a quick look-up of posted payments, discounts, and sales for a given customer.| 112 |
| [Customer List](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=101) | Shows various kinds of basic information for customers, such as customer posting group, discount group, finance charge and payment information, salesperson, the customer's default currency and credit limit in your local currency (LCY), and the customer's current balance (in LCY). The report can be used, for example, to maintain the information in the Customer table.| 101 |

The overdue amounts can be shown by due date, posting date, or by document date as needed. You can choose to show the amounts in local currency (LCY) and print details of the overdue documents. The time intervals can have headings with dates or with number of dates overdue, relative to the specified aging by type.<br>This report is the main report for reconciling vendor ledger to G/L. Assuming that you don't post directly to the payables account for the vendor posting group, this report is a specification of the amounts in the general ledger.| 322|
| [Vendor - Balance to Date](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=321) | Shows the vendor balance by the ending date of the specified date range. You can choose to display the vendor balance in your local currency (LCY). Select the **Include Unapplied Entries** field to show entries that have been closed by the ending date but have been un-applied (opened) at a later date. Select the **Show Entries with Zero Balance** to show vendors with a balance of zero by the ending date of the date filter. The date filter applies to the detailed vendor ledger entries for the entries in the report. If a payment was made after the ending date, and the payment was applied to invoices within the date range, the report includes the invoice. The report includes the invoice because it wasn't closed before the ending date. | 321 |
| [Vendor - Trial Balance](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=329) | Shows the net changes for vendors for the period specified in the date filter, and the net change year-to-date for the corresponding fiscal year. The report is grouped by vendor posting groups and will give a different view of the vendor ledger than the **Aged Accounts Payable** report. **Note**: If you haven't set up accounting periods, Business Central won't know which fiscal year to use. It will either show the year-to-date from the most recent fiscal year or just select the period. The date might not be from the beginning of a year.|329 |

| [Vendor - Summary Aging](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=305)| Legacy report for aged accounts payable. We recommend that you use **Aged Accounts Payables** report instead. You can choose a period length and a date to use as set *overdue per* date.|305|

| [Vendor Pre-Payment Journal](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=317)|Shows the payment journal with payment discount and tolerance information.

| [Vendor - List](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?report=301)|Shows basic information for vendors, such as the vendor posting group, discount and payment information, priority level and the vendor's default currency, and the vendor's current balance (in LCY).
