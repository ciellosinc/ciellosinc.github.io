# Summary 


Microsoft want the Business Central and GP community to advance their technology and get onboard AppSource faster while building a successful subscription-based monetization strategy. This may be a challenge for Business Central Partners on how to transform a Capex model into a Subscription based model or GP Partners to move away from perpetual licensing. Traditional Relationship selling will continue to exist alongside the promotion of AppSource marketing strategies. 

This document explores the discussion points around a successful monetization and marketing strategy to launch on AppSource. 


# Thinking about Strategies 


There are four main strategies to think through when publishing to App Source. 

Revenue generation and monetization: How do I ensure my monetization strategy will encourage revenue generation? 

Value of the Lead: What do you want to do with the Lead? Is there more value attached to the lead than the value of the IP you are selling? Would the lead provide more revenue in implementation services than App licensing costs? Use Marketing Automation even if it is an autoreply to continue dialogue with the Lead. 

Value of the Search: Can you reach an extended audience? When you publish to AppSource you get an SEO join and it will promote your company name significantly. The value of publishing even a free App is huge because it can promote other categories or push traffic back to your website where you can capture further information.

# Monetization Strategies 


## Important Questions 

**Who can download an App on AppSource?** 

Any Business Central tenant in the region you have deployed into can consume the App in their tenant. The control of monetization does not exist within AppSource yet. As well as a Marketing Strategy, you also need to have control elements planned. 

**How should I price my App?** 

Microsoft are recommending using a tiered approach such as lite, medium, and heavy which defines the feature/functionality and price point.  

Consider the value of your App can bring and have three different propositions. If a potential customer can see the App can offer them something from either a value or a price perspective, you are giving the audience something to identify with other than a yes or no decision point. 

**Functionality vs Price or Supported vs Unsupported?** 

Bizaid (CRM segment) are a good example because they took both flavors together and put 3 different pricing options together on a monthly subscription for the tenant and bundled exactly what you get for each price in an easy to read matrix. This is the most successful strategy for subscription-based products. 

**Should I display my Pricing on AppSource?** 

Exposing your pricing on AppSource will empower your audience to identify with pricing levels and decide their own value/price point before contacting you. The user can decide whether to test drive it, contact you for more information or consume immediately and pay directly depending on your payment method. 

**Who can download the App and can you monetize at an individual user or enterprise level?** 

Most tenants are well structured and would need administrator access to the tenant to consume an extension. We are seeing a large increase in small users with licenses purchased through a CSP who can then go straight to AppSource and consume Apps without the same level of control as an Enterprise level customer. 

**How can I control who uses my App?** 

Two options are writing code into the App to take credit card payments or using security tokenization. It is important to consider what strategy to choose because as soon as the App is launched on AppSource, there is little control around the process of what Apps Business Central can consume. 

**If I offer Tokenization, can I do it at a named user or tenant level?** 

You can apply tokenization control at a tenant, user or feature level but you have to code this yourself so it is a greater investment to build it with little extra value to the customer. 

**Can Tokenization be automated?** 

Not right now but some of the bigger partners are considering investing in automatic tokenization but it will affect the design and level of effort to build an App. 

**Should I offer a free trial?** 

Free trials are being presented in AppSource but only because of the lack of monetization code written into Apps and the Partner is offering a free trial because they can’t control the experience. As soon as you put monetization or token control, you can set the experience. 

**Should I offer a Free version of the app?** 

Free versions can be used as a teaser to get the customer invested in the value the paid version can provide and then commercialize in a direct way with the customer. Microsoft would prefer all Apps to be monetized otherwise it is hard for them statistically value how much you are doing and give recognition. Currently there are no KPIs in place around licensing and distribution around tenant counts. 

**What should the payment frequency be?** 

It is recommended to follow the same patterns of licensing that Business Central customers are used to which is monthly pricing with a 12-month minimum. If a customer wants to Capex the cost, you could offer a perpetual model. 

**Should I offer pricing discounts?** 

It is up to you to offer pricing discounts for a long-term commitment but do not undervalue yourself as you move to a subscription-based model. 

**Can I scale the price based on enterprise size?** 

You could write a disclaimer that you are capturing information within the tenant and what you will do with that information. One option in this route is to read the number of companies or overall users and send it back through a HTTP client call back to the tokenization piece and decide how to perform due diligence over license control to provide the correct number of tokens. 

## Things to think about 

- What mechanisms are you going to put in place for automating the monetization point 
- How are you going to control and regulate who uses it? 
- Try to drive the decision point and put it in the hands of the interested party which will speed up the decision making process 
- You have complete control to decide how to map out your pricing and value components of monetization but you also need to take responsibility for building the controls into the app. 

## Recommendations: 

Build a monetization strategy directly into the extension itself e.g. write code to accept credit cards to enable features and functionality 

Look at the App from a value perspective and create multiple tiers of value and price accordingly. Write those rules directly into the App so you have security control and monetization written into the app. 

Create a Pricing matrix detailing what is included at each tier/pricing level for a successful subscription-based model.

# Marketing Strategies 


**How do I successfully market my App on AppSource?** 

Make a compelling marketing orientated video of your app focusing on the value of your solution or customer video case study with users talking about the value of the solution. A 30-45 second video is ideal. Animation also works well but ensure to invest time in the video to narrow the gap between the audience and the value of the solution. A good video will stand out from other Apps and Charge Logic is a good example of using videos and graphics to show the value of the solution. 

**How can people find my App?** 

Users can search directly in AppSource or search for Apps within Business Central. Searching directly in Business Central is hugely powerful and demonstrates the ability for the tenant administrator to immediately interact with the app. 

Categories, Industries and Tags can be used as search criteria as well as bold wording or repeat wording in the description and detail of the App landing page. 

How can I drive sort order in search to be near the top? 

Hyperlink to other pages and make sure that your SEO criteria for those pages match the same search criteria in AppSource. Really think about your patterns and keywords and search terms. 

## Recommendations 

- Have a good landing page on your website to link to from AppSource 
- Have Marketing Automation in place for any Leads that come via AppSource 
- Always demonstrate value within your marketing strategy
