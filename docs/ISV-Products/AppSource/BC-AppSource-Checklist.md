b. Get access to PartnerSource Business Center (PSBC).

Access to PSBC is provided by having an active:

- Solution Provider Agreement (SPA) if you are a reselling partner using the Dynamics Pricelist
- Partner Registration Agreement (PRA) if you are a non-selling partner

c. Fill out the Business Central/NAV addendum to the PRA document. This is a separate document that needs to be requested from Microsoft, via mbsagree@microsoft.com for North America ROC.  Once you have submitted it, Microsoft will extend the developer license to include BC/NAV. You can go through operations support as well, however we have found that emailing is fine, 2-3 day turn around.
